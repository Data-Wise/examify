# Section: Conceptual Understanding

## 1. Measures of Central Tendency [2 pts]

Which measure of central tendency is most affected by extreme outliers?

a) Mode
b) Median
c) **Mean** ✓
d) All are equally affected

## 2. Sample vs Population [2 pts]

A researcher surveys 500 randomly selected voters to predict election results. The 500 voters represent:

a) The population
b) A parameter
c) **A sample** ✓
d) A census

## 3. Correlation Interpretation [2 pts]

A correlation of r = -0.85 indicates:

a) A weak positive relationship
b) A weak negative relationship
c) A strong positive relationship
d) **A strong negative relationship** ✓

# Section: True/False Questions

## 4. [TF] Correlation values range from -1 to +1. → True

## 5. [TF] A p-value of 0.03 means there is a 3% chance the null hypothesis is true. → False

## 6. [TF] The standard deviation can never be negative. → True

## 7. [TF] Increasing sample size decreases the standard error. → True

## 8. [TF] The median is always equal to the mean in any distribution. → False

# Section: Mathematical Notation

## 9. Variance Formula [3 pts]

Which formula correctly represents sample variance?

a) $s^2 = \frac{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n}$
b) **$s^2 = \frac{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}$** ✓
c) $s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(X_i - \mu)^2}{N}}$
d) $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(X_i - \mu)^2}{N}$

## 10. Z-Score Interpretation [2 pts]

A student has a z-score of $z = 2.0$ on an exam. This means:

a) The student scored 2 points above average
b) **The student scored 2 standard deviations above the mean** ✓
c) The student is in the 2nd percentile
d) The student scored twice the average

## 11. Quadratic Formula [2 pts]

Identify the quadratic formula:

a) **$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$** ✓
b) $$E = mc^2$$
c) $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
d) $$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$$

```
