# Pool: Statistics Quiz 1

This quiz covers basic statistics concepts from Chapters 1-3.

# Section: Conceptual Understanding

## 1. Measures of Central Tendency [2 pts]

Which measure of central tendency is most affected by extreme outliers?

a) Mode
b) Median
c) Mean [correct]
d) All are equally affected

## 2. Sample vs Population [2 pts]

A researcher surveys 500 randomly selected voters to predict election results. The 500 voters represent:

a) The population
b) A parameter
c) A sample [correct]
d) A census

# Section: True/False Questions

## 3. [TF] Correlation values range from -1 to +1. → True

## 4. [TF] A p-value of 0.03 means there is a 3% chance the null hypothesis is true. → False

## 5. [TF] The standard deviation can never be negative. → True

# Section: Mathematical Notation

## 6. Variance Formula [3 pts]

Which formula correctly represents sample variance?

a) $s^2 = \frac{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n}$
b) $s^2 = \frac{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}$ [correct]
c) $s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(X_i - \mu)^2}{N}}$
d) $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(X_i - \mu)^2}{N}$

## 7. Z-Score Interpretation [2 pts]

A student has a z-score of $z = 2.0$ on an exam. This means:

a) The student scored 2 points above average
b) The student scored 2 standard deviations above the mean [correct]
c) The student is in the 2nd percentile
d) The student scored twice the average

# Section: Select All That Apply

## 8. [MultiAns, 4pts] Properties of Normal Distribution

Select ALL properties of a normal distribution:
