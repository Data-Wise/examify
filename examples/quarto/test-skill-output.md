# Statistics Quiz - Skill Test


# Section: Descriptive Statistics

1.  \[MC\] What is the mean of 2, 4, 6, 8? \[2pts\]

<!-- -->

1)  4
2)  5 \[x\]
3)  6
4)  7

<!-- -->

2.  \[MC\] Which measure is most affected by outliers? \[1pt\]

<!-- -->

1)  Mean \[x\] // The mean is sensitive to extreme values
2)  Median // The median is resistant to outliers
3)  Mode // The mode is unaffected by outliers
4)  Range

<!-- -->

3.  \[TF\] The variance can never be negative. → True \[1pt\]

# Section: Probability

4.  \[MA\] Select all valid probability values. \[2pts\]

<!-- -->

1)  -0.5
2)  0 \[x\]
3)  0.5 \[x\]
4)  1.0 \[x\]
5)  1.5

<!-- -->

5.  \[MC\] If P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.4, and A and B are independent,
    what is P(A and B)? \[2pts\]

<!-- -->

1)  0.12 \[x\]
2)  0.70
3)  0.10
4)  0.50

> \[feedback\] For independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.3 ×
> 0.4 = 0.12

# Section: Hypothesis Testing

6.  \[TF\] A p-value less than 0.05 always proves the alternative
    hypothesis is true. → False \[1pt\]

7.  \[Short\] What is the name of the error made when rejecting a true
    null hypothesis? \[1pt\]

Answer: Type I error Answer: Type 1 error Answer: Type I

# Section: Formulas and Calculations

8.  \[MC\] The sample variance formula is: \[2pts\]

<!-- -->

1)  $s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}$
2)  $s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$ \[x\]
3)  $s^2 = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$
4)  $s^2 = \frac{\sum x_i^2}{n}$

<!-- -->

9.  \[Num\] If the sample mean is 50 and the sample standard deviation
    is 10, what is the sample variance? \[2pts\]

Answer: 100 ± 0

# Section: Matching

10. \[Match\] Match each term to its definition. \[4pts\]

- Population =\> All individuals of interest in a study
- Sample =\> Subset of the population actually measured
- Parameter =\> Numerical characteristic of a population
- Statistic =\> Numerical characteristic of a sample

# Section: Essay

11. \[Essay, 10pts\] Explain the difference between correlation and
    causation.

Provide at least one example to illustrate your answer.

<div class="proof solution">

<span class="proof-title">*Solution*. </span>**Key points to
include:** - Correlation measures association between variables -
Causation implies one variable directly causes changes in another -
Correlation does not imply causation - Example: Ice cream sales and
drowning deaths are correlated (both increase in summer), but ice cream
doesn’t cause drowning - Requires controlled experiments or careful
causal analysis to establish causation
