# Section: Descriptive Statistics

1. [MC] What is the mean of 2, 4, 6, 8? [2pts]
a) 4
b) 5 [x]
c) 6
d) 7

2. [MC] Which measure is most affected by outliers? [1pt]
a) Mean [x] // The mean is sensitive to extreme values
b) Median // The median is resistant to outliers
c) Mode // The mode is unaffected by outliers
d) Range

3. [TF] The variance can never be negative. → True [1pt]

# Section: Probability

4. [MA] Select all valid probability values. [2pts]
a) -0.5
b) 0 [x]
c) 0.5 [x]
d) 1.0 [x]
e) 1.5

5. [MC] If P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.4, and A and B are independent, what is P(A and B)? [2pts]
a) 0.12 [x]
b) 0.70
c) 0.10
d) 0.50

> [feedback] For independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.3 × 0.4 = 0.12

# Section: Hypothesis Testing

6. [TF] A p-value less than 0.05 always proves the alternative hypothesis is true. → False [1pt]

7. [Short] What is the name of the error made when rejecting a true null hypothesis? [1pt]

Answer: Type I error
Answer: Type 1 error
Answer: Type I

# Section: Formulas and Calculations

8. [MC] The sample variance formula is: [2pts]
a) $s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}$
b) $s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$ [x]
c) $s^2 = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$
d) $s^2 = \frac{\sum x_i^2}{n}$

9. [Num] If the sample mean is 50 and the sample standard deviation is 10, what is the sample variance? [2pts]

Answer: 100 ± 0

# Section: Matching

10. [Match] Match each term to its definition. [4pts]
- Population => All individuals of interest in a study
- Sample => Subset of the population actually measured
- Parameter => Numerical characteristic of a population
- Statistic => Numerical characteristic of a sample

# Section: Essay

11. [Essay, 10pts] Explain the difference between correlation and causation.

Provide at least one example to illustrate your answer.

::: {.solution}
**Key points to include:**
- Correlation measures association between variables
- Causation implies one variable directly causes changes in another
- Correlation does not imply causation
- Example: Ice cream sales and drowning deaths are correlated (both increase in summer), but ice cream doesn't cause drowning
- Requires controlled experiments or careful causal analysis to establish causation
