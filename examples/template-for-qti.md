# Section: Multiple Choice

## 1. What is variance? \[3 pts\]

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(X-\mu)^2}{N}$$

1)  Sum of squares
2)  **Average squared deviation from mean** ✓
3)  Standard deviation
4)  Range

<div class="proof solution">

<span class="proof-title">*Solution*. </span>Variance measures the
average squared deviation from the mean. The formula divides by N for
population variance, or N-1 for sample variance.

</div>

## 2. What does $\beta_1$ represent in regression $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$? \[2 pts\]

1)  The y-intercept
2)  **The slope** ✓
3)  The error term
4)  The correlation coefficient

<div class="proof solution">

<span class="proof-title">*Solution*. </span>$\beta_1$ is the slope
coefficient, representing the expected change in Y for a one-unit
increase in X.

</div>

# Section: True/False

## 3. The coefficient $R^2$ can range from 0 to 1. \[1 pt\] → True

<div class="proof solution">

<span class="proof-title">*Solution*. </span>$R^2$ (coefficient of
determination) represents the proportion of variance explained, always
between 0 and 1.

</div>

## 4. A p-value of 0.03 means there is a 3% chance the null hypothesis is true. \[1 pt\] → False

<div class="proof solution">

<span class="proof-title">*Solution*. </span>The p-value is the
probability of observing data as extreme as what we got, *assuming* the
null is true. It is NOT the probability that the null hypothesis is
true.

</div>

# Section: Essay

## 5. Explain the difference between correlation and causation. \[10 pts\]

Provide at least one example of variables that correlate but have no
causal relationship.

<div class="proof solution">

<span class="proof-title">*Solution*. </span>**Sample Answer:**
Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship
between two variables. Causation implies that one variable directly
affects the other.

**Example:** Ice cream sales and drowning rates are positively
correlated, but ice cream doesn’t cause drowning. Both increase during
summer (confounding variable).

**Key concepts to mention:** - Confounding variables - Reverse
causation - Spurious correlations - “Correlation does not imply
causation”

</div>

# Section: Short Answer

## 6. What Greek letter represents the population mean? \[2 pts\]

Answer: μ, mu

<div class="proof solution">

<span class="proof-title">*Solution*. </span>The population mean is
denoted by $\mu$ (mu). The sample mean is denoted by $\bar{x}$ (x-bar).

</div>

# Section: Numeric

## 7. Calculate the mean of: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 \[3 pts\] ± 0.1

Answer: 6

<div class="proof solution">

<span class="proof-title">*Solution*. </span>Mean =
$\frac{2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6$

</div>
