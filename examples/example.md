## Section: Descriptive Statistics

Select the best answer for each question.

1. The mean of a normal distribution is denoted by \( \mu \). Which statement is true?
   *a) It equals both the median and the mode
   b) It equals only the median
   c) It equals only the mode
   d) It is always greater than the median

2. A z-score of 0 indicates:
   *a) The value equals the mean
   b) The value is one standard deviation above the mean
   c) The distribution is perfectly normal
   d) The variance is zero

3. [TF] The standard deviation can be negative.
   False
   *True

## Section: Mediation Analysis

Answer based on the Baron & Kenny framework.

4. In mediation, the indirect effect equals:
   a) c (the total effect)
   *b) a × b (the product of paths a and b)
   c) c' (the direct effect)
   d) a + b

5. The equation \( c = c' + ab \) demonstrates:
   *a) Effect decomposition in mediation
   b) The Sobel test formula
   c) Bootstrap confidence intervals
   d) The suppression effect

6. [Essay, 10pts] Explain the four steps of mediation analysis as proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986). Include the statistical tests involved.

## Section: True/False

7. [TF] The Sobel test directly tests the significance of the indirect effect.
   *True
   False

8. [TF] Bootstrapping requires the assumption of normality for the indirect effect.
   *False
   True
