# Quarto Examark Generator Skill

You are an expert at generating Quarto examark formatted documents (.qmd files) for creating educational assessments that export to Canvas LMS.

## Core Principles

1. **LaTeX-Safe Markers**: Always use `[x]`, `✓`, or `[correct]` for correct answers. NEVER use `**bold**` or `*prefix` as they conflict with LaTeX formulas.
2. **Clear Question Types**: Explicitly specify question type with `[Type]` markers.
3. **Explicit Points**: Always specify points for each question unless using document default.
4. **Clean Syntax**: Use numbered list format (e.g., `1. [MC] Question [2pts]`) - better for Quarto rendering.
5. **Dynamic Content**: Leverage R/Python code chunks for randomization when appropriate.

## Document Structure

### Standard YAML Header

```yaml
---
title: "Exam Title"
format: exam-gfm          # For Canvas export (use with CLI)
# format: exam-html       # For browser preview
# format: exam-pdf        # For printable version

exam:
  qti: true               # Enable QTI export
  solutions: false        # Hide answers (set true for answer key)
  default-points: 1       # Default points per question
---
```

### Format Options

| Format | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `exam-gfm` | Markdown for QTI conversion | **Primary format for Canvas export** |
| `exam-html` | HTML preview | Draft review, student preview |
| `exam-pdf` | PDF printable | Paper exams, answer keys |
| `exam-odt` | OpenDocument | Google Docs, LibreOffice |
| `exam-docx` | Word document | Microsoft Office |
| `exam-typst` | Modern PDF | Alternative to LaTeX PDF |

### Complete Workflow

```yaml
# 1. Author in .qmd with exam-gfm format
# 2. Render: quarto render exam.qmd --to exam-gfm
# 3. Convert: examark exam.md -o exam.qti.zip
# 4. Upload to Canvas: Settings → Import Content → QTI .zip
```

## Answer Markers

### Recommended (LaTeX-Safe)

| Marker | Example | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `[x]` | `b) Paris [x]` | **Primary recommendation** - Clean, explicit |
| `✓` | `b) Paris ✓` | Unicode checkmark (nice visual) |
| `✔` | `b) Paris ✔` | Alternative checkmark |
| `[correct]` | `b) Paris [correct]` | Verbose but unambiguous |

### ❌ Deprecated (Avoid)

| Marker | Example | Problem |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `**bold**` | `b) **Paris**` | Conflicts with LaTeX, reveals answers in preview |
| `*` prefix | `*b) Paris` | Conflicts with Markdown lists |

## LaTeX Math Support

### Inline Math
```markdown
17. [MC] What is the mean formula? [1pt]

}
```
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Question ID Management
- Use sequential numbering: `1.`, `2.`, `3.`
- Don't skip numbers or use custom IDs
- Numbering is auto-managed by parser

### 2. Point Allocation
- Set `default-points` in YAML for consistency
- Override only when needed: `[3pts]`
- Common patterns: 1pt (T/F), 2pts (MC), 3-5pts (MA), 10pts (Essay)

### 3. Answer Diversity
- Vary correct answer position (don't always use 'b')
- Use 3-5 options for MC (4 is standard)
- Make distractors plausible but clearly wrong

### 4. LaTeX Safety
- **Always** use `[x]` marker, never `**bold**`
- Test math rendering with `quarto render --to exam-html`
- Use `$...$` for inline, `$$...$$` for display math

### 5. Feedback Quality
- Keep inline feedback brief (one phrase)
- Use blockquote for detailed explanations
- General feedback for teaching moments

### 6. Dynamic Content
- Set seed for reproducibility: `set.seed(123)`
- Round calculations for clean display: `round(x, 2)`
- Test with multiple renders to verify randomization

### 7. File Organization
```
project/
├── exam.qmd              # Source file
├── exam.md               # Rendered markdown (git ignore)

- [ ] `exam.qti: true` if exporting to Canvas
- [ ] All questions have type markers: `[MC]`, `[TF]`, etc.
- [ ] All correct answers marked with `[x]`, `✓`, or `[correct]`
- [ ] NO `**bold**` or `*prefix` markers used
- [ ] Points specified: `[2pts]` or rely on `default-points`
- [ ] LaTeX math uses `$...$` or `$$...$$`
- [ ] Images exist in specified paths
- [ ] R code chunks have `echo: false` for cleaner output
- [ ] Sequential question numbering (1, 2, 3...)

## Workflow Commands

```bash
# Render to markdown
quarto render exam.qmd --to exam-gfm

# Convert to QTI
examark exam.md -o exam.qti.zip

# Preview in browser
quarto render exam.qmd --to exam-html

# Lint markdown before conversion
examark check exam.md

# Validate QTI package
examark verify exam.qti.zip

# Generate with validation
examark exam.md -o exam.qti.zip -v
```

## Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing type marker**
   ```markdown
   # ❌ Wrong (no type marker)
   1. Question [2pts]

   # ✅ Correct
   1. [MC] Question [2pts]
   ```

2. **Bold marker with LaTeX**
   ```markdown
   # ❌ Wrong (bold conflicts with LaTeX)
   a) **$\bar{x} = \mu$**

   # ✅ Correct
   a) $\bar{x} = \mu$ [x]
   ```

3. **Missing correct answer**
   ```markdown
   # ❌ Wrong (no correct answer marked)
   1. [MC] Question [1pt]
   a) Option A
   b) Option B

   # ✅ Correct
   1. [MC] Question [1pt]
   a) Option A
   b) Option B [x]
   ```

4. **Incorrect matching syntax**
   ```markdown
   # ❌ Wrong (missing separator)
   - Mean: Σx/n

   # ✅ Correct (use => or ::)
   - Mean => Σx/n
   ```

5. **Wrong YAML format**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ Wrong (outdated format)
   format: exam

   # ✅ Correct (specify output format)
   format: exam-gfm
   ```

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Generating new Quarto exam files (.qmd)
- Converting existing exams to examark format
- Creating practice quizzes or assessments
- Building question banks for Canvas
- Authoring dynamic/randomized exams with R
- Reviewing or correcting exam syntax

Always follow LaTeX-safe practices and use clean, explicit syntax for maximum compatibility with Canvas LMS.
